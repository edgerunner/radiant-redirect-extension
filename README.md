Radiant Redirect Extension
==========================

This is a simple extension for Radiant CMS that keeps a list of redirections in the database, and redirects to the specified `to path` when a listed `from path` is requested.

It is very beta now and probably has a lot of bugs.

To-do list
----------

* Handle query strings
* Use wildcards or regexp
* Do not hit the database for every request
