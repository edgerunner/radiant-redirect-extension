= Radiant Redirect Extension

This is a simple extension for Radiant CMS that keeps a list of redirections in the database, and redirects to the specified *to path* when a listed *from path* is requested.

It is very beta now and probably has a lot of bugs.

== To-do list

* Handle query strings
* Use wildcards or regexp
* Do not hit the database for every request
